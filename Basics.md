## Basic Procedure
1. The Referee Describes the situation the players find themselves in 
2. The players ask questions and get answers to clarify the situation
3. The referee goes around the table collecting the actions for each figure 
4. The referee resolves all actions and describes the new situation beginning back at step 1. 

## Basic Resolution
For the most part what is most likely to happen just happens. If you climb a rope, you get to the top. If you swim across a lake you swim across the lake. You offer a peace deal which benefits the other party greatly, you succeed in negotiations. The logical next step is the basic resolution of the game. 

### Dice Based Resolution
When the situation is dire, and there is an obvious threat of failure. You may roll dice to determine the outcome. For example you might try climbing a rope hanging over a spiked pit while carrying something incredibly bulky or swimming across a raging river, or attempt to negotiate with a figure who threatens you with grave harm. In this case we can use dice to determine the outcome. 

To do so, *Throw* 2 six-sided dice (2d6)... 
* +skill level for relevant skill
* On a result of 8 or higher, you succeed, on a result of 7 or lower you fail. 

> **When Not to Use Dice**
> It can be tempting for the novice referee to call for dice to be thrown at every opportunity. The same goes for the novice player who may ask if their figure can make a throw to resolve nearly any minor conflict. After all, the players are wont to find danger and so "danger is everywhere, time to roll some dice"! It cannot be over stated how dangerous this is to your game. As overuse of dice creates a farce, a situation ?wherein figures of all kinds are shown to be grossly incompetent. This becomes a slapstick routine far more than it does a tale of heroes facing off against grave danger. 
> This issue is compounded doubly when we consider the "social skills" such as liaison. If a the average figure, and remember the average figure *lacks* skill, is asked to throw liaison when making friends with like minded people we have created a situation wherein nearly 95% of the time the figures in question will fail!
> Thus the danger must be clear and great. If the mission relies on a spy making friends with the duke at his annual ball, perhaps then liaison is called for. If the costs are high (the loss of a critical ally in a time of need).
