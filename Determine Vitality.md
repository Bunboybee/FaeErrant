# Determine Vitality
Throw 2d6 twice and keep the higher score. This score is your maximum vitality(VIT). Vitality has two primary uses: 

### Upkeep Guard
Certain guards (such as a shield or a sword) require you to pay 1 vitality as an upkeep cost each round of combat. Multiple guards of this kind *DO NOT* require multiple vitality to upkeep. The maximum spent VIT should be 1 per turn.

### Cast Spells
Depending on the complexity of the spell (see [magic](srd/magic)) you must expend a certain amount of vitality to cast the spell. 

## Regaining Vitality 
Vitality returns at a rate of 1 per hour spent resting, back up to your maximum VIT score. 

## No Vitality
If you are out of vitality when you attempt to gain the upper hand roll one more die than typical and discard the highest die.
