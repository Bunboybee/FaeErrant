An Elf Game is a game where one or more Players gather around a table (or a digital space as is oft the case today) to pretend to live in a fantastic world, a creation shared by the these players at the table. One player will take on the role of the Referee, while the others will take on the role of Figures. 

The referee is in charge of fairly and evenhandedly determining the results of the actions taken by players, but players themselves cannot interface with the world of fantasy which we live in. Instead they must create avatars which may act in this world for them, called Figures. The Players then take turns acting as these figures in world. 

A figure might be anything, from a powerful dragon to a human equipped with only the barest essentials. This breadth of what a figure is makes the creation of such figures from whole cloth tricky. For this reason there exists a procedure for making figures within certain parameters. It is suggested to use this procedure when learning to play the game as it helps keep the fiction grounded within certain limits. 

You'll find that procedures like this one are spread throughout the book in fact, and their use is much the same. A great starting point, but not the end all be all of the game. Sometimes it makes sense to break from these or to make your own things up. This is one of the reasons for the referee, to help guide the fiction of a world where anything can happen by attempting to keep the game "fair" within reason.
