# Introduction
Why does this game exist is a question that I have asked myself over and over again as I have progressed in the making of it. First, it was intended to be a true to 1973 proto-D&D, then it morphed into a romantic fantasy that attempted to be deeply medievalist. Then it became a bit of a brain worm that rotted away in my brain for almost 3 years before finally seeing the light of day. What it is is now is answered below but *why* it is remains to be seen. I've been playing TTRPGs for many years, and I can say without a shadow of a doubt that there is something magical and ineffable about running your game. That's it, that's why this exists. Because running a game made by me feels special in a way no other game feels. This is mine, and I encourage all people to make their own games. To make their own content. To embrace the  "DIY spirit" of the OSR and actually use *your* content in *your* game. 

This game remains many of the things it had been. It is hodgepodge mess of translated chainmail mechanics seen in a totally new way and skill based design. It has the original Blackmoor classes, sage and merchant added back into the game. It has a romantic heart, but more than that it has a piece of me in it. A little Shinto-buddhism, a little dao, a heaping helping of Jewish mysticism, it is the places I have lived the people I have met a little world and game system married together to represent something that cannot be made by anyone else but me. 

I hope you enjoy this little piece of me.
